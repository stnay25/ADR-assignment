# ADR University network app

* Decision title: Cross-Platform Framework Selection

* Status: Accepted 

* Deciders: Stadium Nay

* Date: 2023-10-07

* Context and Problem Statement:
The goal is to develop a social networking mobile app for a university. The app needs to be accessible for both IOS and Android platforms. We must select a framework or technology stack that allows for efficient development and ongoing maintenance across multiple platforms to accomplish this task. 

* Considered Options:
[1] React Native
[2] Xamarin 
[3] Flutter
[4] ArkUI
[5] Kivy

* Decision:
The cross-platform framework that was chosen for the university social networking app was React Native.

* Rationale:
There were several cross-platform options when deciding on this development. But the chosen framework is React Native because it is the best fit for this project requirement for the following reasons:

This framework is widely adopted and has a large community, meaning access to resource wealth, libraries, and third-party plugins.

It has great efficiency and can write a single codebase that works on both IOS and Android platforms, reducing time in development, maintenance, and debugging. 

Also, it has great performance and accessibility, has robust support features and provides native module integration.

Offer tools and features that facilitate offline data storage and synchronization.

It actively has ongoing support and updates in the framework. 

* Consequences:
While the React Native framework is a great cross-platform for development, there might be some need for platform-specific code for certain scenarios, such as certain particle features and performance optimization. Also, the development team needs to become proficient in React Native if they aren’t already familiar with the framework. But overall the benefit of this framework outweighs these potential problems.  

* Follow-Up Action: 
Training sessions or workshops to improve team members' skills and knowledge with React Native. The training will cover the fundamentals of React Native and other information that will improve the team's skills. 

Ensure the team stays up to date with the latest developments and releases of React Native. Regular updates for the team will improve the development workflow. 

Creates comprehensive guidelines and documentation for managing platform-specific code or optimization when it’s necessary. This ensures that the team members are well aware and informed about using guidelines. 

Establish a well-structured strategy that tests both IOS and Android devices to identify and address any issue that is spotted in performance.  

Implementing these follow-up actions would increase the benefit of using React Native while decreasing the potential challenge and ensuring successful development in the process.
