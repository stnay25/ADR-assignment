# ADR University network app

* Decision title: Data Privacy and Security

* Status: Accepted 

* Deciders: Stadium Nay

* Date: 2023-10-07

* Context and Problem Statement:
The task is to prioritize data privacy and security for university social networking mobile apps. This includes securing sensitive data and transmission while complying with data protection regulations like GDPR and HIPAA. 

* Considered Options:
[1] Compliance with Data Protection Regulation
[2] End-to-end encryption and secure data transmission
[3] Third-party Security Services
[4] Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing  

* Decision:
The chosen implementation for the university network mobile app is end-to-end encryption, secure data transmission, regular security testing, and regulation compliance. 

* Rationale:
Data privacy and compliance with regulation are important to maintaining user trust and legal compliance. 

Implementing end-to-end encryption and secure data transmission protocols makes sure that any sensitive data remains confidential and during the process, it will be protected.

Regular security testing and penetration are important to identify any security risk before it can be exploited. 


* Consequences:
End-to-end encryption and secure data transmission implementation may get very complex during the process, the development requires very careful handling. 

Sticking to data protection regulations requires constant effort to stay up to date with evolving requirements.
Regular security audits and penetration testing will cost lots of money. 


* Follow-Up Action:

The development team will be responsible for putting in encryption and secure data transmission protocols and doing testing throughout the process. 

The team will also monitor any changes in data protection regulations and make sure they comply with them. 

Documentation on data privacy and security practices will be created to educate the team and to make sure the roles are followed.

Security audits and testing will be scheduled at a specific time or event so that it can identify any sort of security risk. 

This action will establish a robust data privacy and security framework for the university networking app.
